# Word Guessing Game with Flask

## Overview

This is a Python-based word guessing game developed using Flask. The game presents the user with a definition of a word, and the player must guess the word. It is a fun way to enhance general knowledge, and you can even play with friends.

The principle of the game is simple:
1. A random word is generated.
2. A definition is displayed, and the word is hidden.
3. The user tries to guess the word based on the definition.
4. Once the word is guessed, it is revealed.

The game integrates JavaScript for event handling, CSS and HTML for design, and Python for API processing.
